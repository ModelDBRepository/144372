This is the readme for the model associated with the paper:

Stiefel KM, Gutkin BS, Sejnowski TJ (2009) The effects of cholinergic
neuromodulation on neuronal phase-response curves of modeled cortical
neurons. J Comput Neurosci 26:289-301

This model was contributed by Klaus Stiefel and "... incorporates the
spatial structure of the dendrites and is based on a reconstructed
cortical layer II pyramidal neuron (Mainen and Sejnowski 1995)."  See
Stiefel et al. 2009 for more.
